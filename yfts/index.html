				<div><p>After viewing Episode II upon its release, my viewing group and I emerged from the theater, stood beneath the box office signs at the front of the theater, and performed a ritual that I'm sure many of you share, whereupon we clear up confusions, share opinions, and attempt to classify what we had just seen. To this day, I clearly remember a good friend of mine saying, “People will argue because of nostalgia, but that was the best Star Wars yet.” The rest of us stood there flabbergasted because Episode II was quite obviously not the best Star Wars yet, nor even very good to begin with.</p>
<p>Thirteen years later, I feel like I am reliving that moment. Only instead we are talking about Episode VII, and rather than it being my one friend, it is nearly everyone who has expressed an opinion to me or written a review that I've read on the internet. Perhaps people aren't saying that it was the best Star Wars, but they're positively comparing it to the original trilogy. And once again I am flabbergasted, because Episode VII was terrible.</p></div>

				<div>The 2014 World Cup recently began in Brazil, a nation lacking in the sanitation, infrastructure, public safety, and financial resources that are usually required to host an international spectacle of this level. Yet, one other thing acts as a larger blight over the event than any of these others. That is the sport of soccer itself. I believe that soccer is an objectively bad sport — one of the worst sports in the world, in fact — and I will attempt to prove that here.</div>

				<div>Lorde came out of nowhere last year, nowhere being a nickname for Middle Earth (more commonly known as New Zealand), with some nonsense song that is barely about a baseball team from Kansas City. What it’s mostly about isn’t baseball, but rather a hollow criticism of hip hop lyricism. Most specifically, the stunting and braggadocio that is ever-present across the genre.</div>

				<div>Kevin Durant gave a speech upon winning the NBA MVP award this week. People are proclaiming his speech as “powerful”, “emotional”, and other words than indicate something far more impressive than what it was. They’re calling it the greatest MVP speech of all time. I think people wanted to be moved by it because everyone loves KD. He’s humble, he plays hard, he gives back to his community, he never speaks ill of his teammates, coaches, or really anyone. And oh yeah, he’s an incredibly good basketball player with an exciting game that results in a lot of points. He’s everything you want in a sports superstar.</div>
