				<div>Before I begin my review, I need to make a confession. I didn't like this movie before it started. I have disliked it for months. Ever since the first preview that showed actual footage from the movie, I've thought it was going to be a disaster. I'll get into the why's as part of my review, but I just need to be clear that my expectations do not mean that I simply searched for justification as I viewed Star Trek, and that I ignored everything else that did not support my negative assumptions. In fact, there have been numerous cases where a movie far exceeded my initial thinking. In the interest of thoroughness, I'll even cite examples. My first impression of Gladiator was that it was going to be a lame Spartacus knockoff. It ended up being the best American action movie of this decade. I thought Rocky 6 was going to be as big a disgrace as Rocky 5. I ended up seeing it four times in the theaters. I thought Tropic Thunder would be just another lame Ben Stiller movie, and it's one of the funniest comedies I've seen in years. Yes, I make flash judgments. I believe that everyone does. The difference is that I'm not ashamed of it, and I'm as willing as anyone to change my thinking. All that being said, I was convinced that Star Trek would be utter crap, and I was right.</div>
