	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	<div>
		<span class="question">What the hell is this place?</span>
		<span class="answer">
			It's a place for showing off my creative endeavors and
			hopefully making the world a little more miserable.
		</span>
		<span class="question">What does epicaricacy mean?</span>
		<span class="answer">
			It means "rejoicing at or finding pleasure in the misfortune of others."
			You may also know it as schadenfreude.
		</span>
		<span class="question">
			Well then why didn't you name it Schadenfreude.com?
		</span>
		<span class="answer">
			Two reasons, actually. One is that the domain was taken. The other,
			more important reason is that epicaricacy is English, which is what I
			speak. I'm not going to	adopt a filthy German word if I don't have to.
		</span>
		<span class="question">So what, do you actually have epicaricacy?</span>
		<span class="answer">Yes.</span>
		<span class="question">
			Aren't you just trying to dress up the fact that
			you're a troll?
		</span>
		<span class="answer">
			I'm not dressing anything up.
		</span>
		<span class="question">
			Why is the text in Comic Sans?
		</span>
		<span class="answer">
			Because there is a significant group of people who believe that you
			should never use Comic Sans. They make this claim because they have
			been told that it is the truth. It is an example of groupthink. If
			you challenge these people to explain it, they rarely have good reasons.
			The ones that do, if they're being reasonable, will eventually admit that
			there are some instances where using Comic Sans is actually sensible (for
			example, in a comic strip), and so they were overgeneralizing.
		</span>
		<span class="question">
			This isn't a comic strip. Why are you using it here?
		</span>
		<span class="answer">
			To piss those people off. See the definition of epicaricacy above.
		</span>
		<span class="question">This site blows.</span>
		<span class="answer">That wasn't a question.</span>
		<span class="question">This site blows?</span>
		<span class="answer">Yep.</span>
		<span class="question">Why not make it better?</span>
		<span class="answer">
			I'm working on it. The good thing about a website is that it's
			never finished, so it can keep getting better. You, on the other hand,
			are stuck my friend.
		</span>
		<span class="question">I'm not your friend.</span>
		<span class="answer">That wasn't a question.</span>
		<span class="question">I'm not your friend?</span>
		<span class="answer">
			Hah! Of course not! Nobody likes you, me least of all.
		</span>
		<span class="question">
			What makes these questions "Frequently Asked"?
		</span>
		<span class="answer">
			Well, they've been asked exactly once. By me. Every other question
			related to the site has been asked zero times. So, by default, they're
			the most frequent.
		</span>
		<span class="question">That's stupid.</span>
		<span class="answer">That wasn't a question.</span>
		<span class="question">That's stupid?</span>
		<span class="answer">No it's not.</span>
		<span class="question">
			Isn't this list just an excuse to put content on a site that is otherwise
			suffering from a severe dearth of it?
		</span>
		<span class="answer">Yes.</span>
