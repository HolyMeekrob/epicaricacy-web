			Here are some samples of fiction that I've written. I guarantee that it
			won't be the worst thing that you've ever read on the internet.

		<dl class="relative">
			<dt><a href="/fiction/battery/">Battery</a></dt>
			<dd>
				A short story about two brothers facing off in a crucial baseball
				game. It is very loosely based on my relationship with one of my
				brothers. Fun note: It is very lightly implied that the victorious
				brother plays for the Yankees. Because in my stories, the Yankees
				will always win.
			</dd>
			<dt><a href="/fiction/meeting_the_neighbors/">Meeting the Neighbors</a></dt>
			<dd>
				A short story about a man who wrongfully became a sex offender and
				was legally required to go around introducing himself to the
				neighborhood. Fun note: This was inspired by the scene in The Big
				Lebowski where Jesus has to do the same thing.
			</dd>
			<dt><a href="/fiction/the_modern_family/">The Modern Family</a></dt>
			<dd>
				A short story about a really depressed family. It was an attempt
				to do dark comedy and to do something really strange with the
				narration. Also, I wrote (and titled) this well before the TV show
				ever came out. Fun note: I wrote this shortly after reading "The
				Things They Carried" by Tim O'Brien. The original title was "The
				Things They Hated".
			</dd>
			<dt><a href="/fiction/tytf">Harry Potter and the Year Time Forgot</a></dt>
			<dd>
				I loathe the Harry Potter novels. Despite this fact, I read all of
				them. The reason I did so was to be able to win arguments with people
				who like the books. By reading the whole series, I had all of the
				facts. After many arguments where I found myself repeating everything,
				I decided to write all of them down. What better way to do so then
				by creating fan fiction that points out everything that makes the
				books terrible? Please note that I attempted to emulate the style of
				JK Rowling, and that's why the writing itself is bad. Fun note:
				Newton Crosby was named after Steve Guttenberg's character in the film
				Short	Circuit.
			</span>
			<dt><a href="/fiction/8/">8</a></dt>
			<dd>
				My first award winner! Well, it was a third place award (Austin
				Chronicle's 2013 Short Story contest). I won money though, so it
				counts. It's about a breakup, and I'll leave it at that, since the
				exact interpretation can be open-ended. This wasn't inspired by any
				of my breakups in particular, but rather the common way in which they
				all affected me. Fun note: I inserted a lot of references to the
				number eight within the story, some more disguised than others. See
				how many you can spot!
